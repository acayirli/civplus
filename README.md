# civplus
A website that provides useful tools for the game Civilization.

Currently there is only a drafter and a learn page, where you can find tips how to play each leader.

In the future there will also be a tool to generate equally balanced teams from a list of players with skill ratings.

Also the learn page will be expanded to included some basic cheatsheets which can be useful while playing (for beginngers).
